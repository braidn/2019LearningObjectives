# 2019 Learning Objectives.

AKA a playground for everything being explored programming wise in 2019. 
This Repo currently is utilizing the following technologies:

1. CockroachDB: A newish, Postgres like HIGHLY FAULT TOLLERANT DB.
1. Elixir: Something fast, that I learned forever ago. Re-familliarizing myself this year.
1. ReasonML: Current favorite compile to JS language.
1. Reason-React: React like wrapper over Reason.
1. Packal: Because why would you need all that extra webpack generated code?
